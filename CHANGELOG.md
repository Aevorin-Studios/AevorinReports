# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-09-05

### New Features & Improvements

- **Reload Sub-Commands:** `/ar reload` and `/aevorinreports reload` now require a sub-argument specifying what to reload: `<all|config|lang>`.
  - `all` — reloads both configuration and language files.
  - `config` — reloads configuration only.
  - `lang` — reloads language files only.
  - Invalid or missing arguments display a usage hint. Tab completion suggests `reload`, then `all`, `config`, and `lang`.
- **Russian (ru_RU) Language Support:** Added full Russian translation across all GUI, chat, and Discord sections.
- **Persist `lastUpdatedBy` Field:** Added `last_updated_by` column to SQLite/MySQL DDL, `ensureTableSchema` migration, `updateReport` SQL, and all SELECT mappings.
- **MySQL Schema Completeness:** `CREATE TABLE` now includes all columns (`created_at`, `updated_at`, `evidence_data`, `coordinates`, `world`, `last_updated_by`), previously relying entirely on ALTER TABLE fallback.
- **Timestamps in GUI:** `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, and `lastUpdatedBy` are now displayed in `ReportManageGUI` chest lore and book pages.
- **Discord Embed Footer:** `sendLogUpdate` embed now includes a footer with timestamp and a `createdAt` field.
- **Report History Tracking:** `report_history` table is now actively used — status changes are recorded via `insertHistory()`.
- **New PAPI Placeholders:** Added `%reports_last_submitted_date%` and `%reports_last_against_date%`.
- **Updated Placeholders.md:** Added documentation for the new date placeholders.

### Bug Fixes

- **SetReportStatusCommand Timestamp:** Fixed stale `updatedAt` timestamp — `updatedAt` is now set to `now()` before saving.

### Localization

- Added new keys `created_at`, `updated_at`, `last_updated_by` (book + container lore) and Discord `status-update` footer to all 9 language files: `en_US`, `ru_RU`, `de_DE`, `it_IT`, `nl_NL`, `pl_PL`, `sk_SK`, `vi_VN`, `zh_CN`.
- Added `usage-reload`, `reload-all-success`, `reload-config-success`, and `reload-lang-success` to all language files.
- Bumped `config-version` to 4 in all language files.

### Database

- Added `getLastReportDateByReporter`, `getLastReportDateAgainst`, and `insertHistory` database methods.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-08-27

### New Features & Improvements
- **Language Optimization:** Only language files explicitly configured in `config.yml` are loaded into memory, significantly reducing startup time and memory footprint.
- **Cross-Server Notifications:** Added real-time cross-server report notifications by periodically polling the shared database, allowing staff on any server to be alerted of new reports.
- **Discord Localization:** Added a `discord` section to all language files (config-version 3), bringing localized Discord commands, report details, notifications, help text, and status messages. German and English translations are currently included.
- **FastStats Upgrade:** Upgraded FastStats dependency to version 0.29.0 and migrated to the new `BukkitContext` API.
- **Discord Integrations:** Routed slash command replies, embeds, and command descriptions through `LanguageManager`. Report status changes now record the latest updater and automatically synchronize Discord log updates.

### Bug Fixes
- **Offline Player Resolution:** Added `reporter_name` and `reported_name` caching columns to the database schema. This fixes the issue where players who had never joined the staff member's server would show up as "Unknown" in GUIs and Discord.
- **Thread Safety:** Improved report handling responsiveness by moving heavy database work off the main thread.
- **Discord Shutdown:** Gracefully await JDA shutdown on plugin disable to completely avoid "zip file closed" exceptions and memory leaks after `/reload`.
- **General Fixes:** Clearer handling of unavailable players and missing translations.

### Performance
- **Active Reports Limit:** Now uses a single `COUNT` query for the active reports limit instead of loading all player reports into memory.
- **Async Saves:** Save reports asynchronously and apply cooldowns immediately to prevent spam while the `INSERT` query is in flight.
- **Async GUIs:** Run GUI click SQL queries asynchronously and reopen inventories back on the main thread (Folia-safe via `SchedulerUtils`, guarded by `isOnline`).
- **Tab Complete Caching:** Cache offline player names for tab-complete with a 5-minute TTL and async refresh, completely avoiding iterating through `getOfflinePlayers()` per tab completion.
- **Placeholder Caching:** Added a 30-second TTL cache to PlaceholderAPI expansion responses to reduce database load.
- **Database Indexing:** Added SQL indexes on `reporter_uuid`, `reported_uuid`, `status`, `server_name+status`, and `updated_at` to drastically improve report search and retrieval speed.

### Special Thanks

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-20

### Improvements & Bug Fixes

- Added support for reporting offline players who have played on the server before.
  - `/report <player>` now resolves targets through Bukkit `OfflinePlayer`, allowing reports against cached offline players while still rejecting unknown players.
  - Added `reports.allow-offline-player-reporting` to `config.yml`, defaulting to `true`, so servers can disable offline-player reporting if desired.
  - Report creation now stores the resolved offline player's UUID and keeps custom-reason and GUI report flows working with offline targets.
  - Report command tab completion now includes cached offline players in addition to online players when offline-player reporting is enabled.
- PlaceholderAPI placeholders are now parsed in built-in GUI text, including book GUI text and container GUI titles, item names, and lore.
  - This allows placeholders such as `%reports_total_pending%` to display live values in configured GUI text.
- Cleaned up Java imports in the language manager for improved readability.

### Language Support

- Added **German** language support.
- Added **Dutch** language support.
- Added **Vietnamese** language support.

## [1.0.9.1] - 2026-06-05

### Improvements & Bug Fixes

- Localized status placeholders now use language-file values instead of raw enum names.
  - Affected `{status}` placeholders now display values such as `common.status.pending` instead of `PENDING`.
  - Applies to report details, status-change messages, hover text, current-status lore, and empty status-list messages.
- Fixed `/reports <status>` ignoring `reports.gui.type: container`.
  - Commands such as `/reports REJECTED` now open the configured container GUI directly instead of opening a book first.
- Updated the Shadow build plugin to fix ASM relocation failures during `shadowJar` on newer Gradle/JDK environments.

### Contributors

## [1.0.8] - 2026-03-31

### New Features

- **Standardized Messaging System**:
  - Replaced hardcoded messages with localized strings via `LanguageManager`.
  - Fully localized command usage strings (`/report`, `/viewreport`, `/setreportstatus`) for all supported languages.
  - Added localized feedback for the `/ar reload` command.
- **Custom Reason Support in GUIs**:
  - Added "Custom Reason" option to the **Book GUI**.
  - Added "Custom Reason" (Writable Book) icon to the **Container GUI** for players to submit their own reasons in chat.
- **Enhanced Visual Aesthetics**:
  - Implemented high-fidelity **MiniMessage gradients** for report titles, details, and notifications.
  - Simplified GUI design by removing bold text for a cleaner, modern look.
  - Redesigned the container separator for better visual structure.
- **Improved Global Prefix**: The plugin prefix now supports MiniMessage gradients and is consistently applied across all messages using the `{prefix}` placeholder.

### Improvements & Bug Fixes

- **Hybrid Message Parsing**: Implemented a robust "Hybrid Parser" for messages that contain both MiniMessage tags and legacy color codes (e.g., gradients combined with `&f`). This resolves a critical `ParsingException` where MiniMessage would crash when encountering legacy formatting symbols like `§`.
- **FastStats Reliability**: Fixed a `NullPointerException` (NPE) that occurred during FastStats initialization if the database connection failed or was slow to respond.
- **Streamlined Initialization**: Simplified console output during startup by removing verbose database connection logs and retry spam. Initialization failures are now reported as a single, clear sentence before the plugin disables itself.
- **GUI Pagination Fix**: Resolved a critical indexing error in the `Reason Selector` GUI that prevented "Next Page" from working when reasons spanned multiple pages.
- **Robust Reason Selection**: Implemented `PersistentDataContainer` (PDC) to identify report reasons in the GUI. This makes reason selection immune to translation changes and fixes a bug where non-English reasons would fail to submit.
- **Smart Message Parsing**: Enhanced `MessageUtils` with a heuristic to detect legacy color codes versus MiniMessage tags. This fixes a rendering bug where command usage strings like `<player>` were being incorrectly parsed as broken MiniMessage.
- **Dynamic Prefix Replacement**: Re-engineered the `LanguageManager` to replace `{prefix}` _before_ MiniMessage parsing, preventing crashes when the prefix contains non-legacy characters.
- **Robust Category Handling**: Switched to `PersistentDataContainer` for identifying report categories in GUIs, ensuring stability across all localized versions.
- **Unified Feedback**: Standardized status update notifications so that using the `/setreportstatus` command and the GUI management buttons provide the same detailed feedback.
- **Improved Input Validation**:
  - Validated report categories and custom reasons directly in the `/report` command.
  - Fixed length validation for custom reasons to correctly use localized error messages.
- **Language Cleanup**: Removed redundant and unused keys from language files (`status-update-success`, `description-too-short`, etc.) to reduce clutter and improve maintainability.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-03-11

### New Features

- **Full Localization Support**: Implemented a comprehensive language system.
  - New `lang/` folder for storing language packs (e.g., `en_US.yml`).
  - Active language selection via `language` setting in `config.yml`.
  - Added default `en_US.yml` with all GUI and message strings.
- **Localized GUIs**: Refactored all user interfaces to be fully translatable.
  - `ReportManageGUI`: Localized all labels and status buttons.
  - `CategoryContainerGUI`: Localized navigation and indicators.
  - `ReportReasonContainerGUI`: Localized the entire reason selection flow.
  - `BookGUI`: Localized the classic book-based reporting and management views.
- **Localized Commands**: All command feedback and staff notifications are now localized via the language pack.
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Added "Back" buttons to all container-based GUIs.
  - New "Back to Categories" button in the category view for easier navigation between report groups.
  - New "Back to Category" button in the individual report management view, allowing staff to return quickly to the filtered list.
  - Back buttons use localized display names and lore, including dynamic status placeholders.
- **Official Language Support**: Expanded the built-in language library.
  - Added official support for **Italian (it_IT)** and **Slovak (sk_SK)**.
- **Integrated FastStats Telemetry**: Added advanced server metrics and automated error tracking via FastStats.
  - **Live Metrics**: We now track pending reports, preferred GUI types, and database backends to help improve future updates.
  - **Automated Error Tracking**: Plugin exceptions are now automatically transmitted with context to our developers, allowing us to fix bugs before you even report them.
- **Improved Telemetry Coexistence**: FastStats now runs alongside bStats, providing a more comprehensive overview of plugin usage and health.

### Improvements & Bug Fixes

- **Book GUI Smart Pagination**: Fixed a bug where the text in the Book GUI would overflow and get cut off at the bottom of the page. The plugin now intelligently flows content onto a new page only when necessary.
- **Language Extraction Fix**: Fixed an issue where bundled language files (`it_IT.yml`, `sk_SK.yml`) would not extract to the `lang/` folder unless explicitly set as the active language. Now all supported languages extract automatically on startup.
- **Improved Language Management**:
  - **Custom Language Support**: Custom language files will never be overwritten during plugin updates.
  - **Smart Fallback System**: Missing keys in custom language files automatically fall back to `en_US` defaults.
  - **Missing Key Warnings**: Console warnings are displayed when custom language files have missing fields.
  - **Automatic Internal Updates**: Supported languages are auto-updated when the plugin jar is updated.
- **GUI Interaction Fix**: Fixed a bug where both admins and players could accidentally take items out of the container-based GUIs.
- **Security & Privacy**:
  - Fixed a missing permission check in the Book GUI that allowed non-admin players to see "Click to change status" options.
  - Management buttons are now context-aware and only shown to players with the correct permissions.
- **Build Process Optimization**: Fixed a critical issue where the Gradle build process was corrupting `\n` newline characters in language files.
- **Enhanced GUI Stability**: Re-engineered the internal GUI identification system using `InventoryHolder`.
- **Refined Config Logic**: Updated internal configuration handling to support advanced telemetry metrics.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved the `ExceptionHandler` to provide better context for remote debugging.

    - **Smart Fallback System**: If a custom language file is missing specific keys required for the GUIs or messages, the plugin will now automatically use the default `en_US` values as a fallback.
    - **Missing Key Warnings**: A warning will be displayed in the console if your custom configuration is missing fields, helping you identify what needs to be added.
  - **Automatic Internal Updates**: Supported languages (`en_US`, `it_IT`, `sk_SK`) are automatically updated when the plugin jar is updated, while preserving your `config.yml` settings.

### Improvements & Bug Fixes

- **GUI Interaction Fix**: Fixed a bug where both admins and players could accidentally take items (like report books or action icons) out of the container-based GUIs and place them in their own inventory.

- **Improved Database Logging**: Structured log messages for server renames, table schema updates, and database connectivity issues.
- **Code Audit**: Audited the entire codebase to ensure all component logs follow a standardized logging format.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-01-29

### Configuration & Persistence

- **Next-Gen Configuration Update System**: Re-engineered the entire configuration engine to support automated, comment-preserving updates. When a new plugin version (detected via `config-version`) requires configuration changes, the system now:
  - Creates a safe backup of your existing settings as `config.yml.old`.
  - Seamlessly migrates all user data into the updated structure while perfectly preserving all custom comments, layout, and section headers.
- **Fixed Critical Config Crashing**: Added resilient type-handling to prevent the plugin from shutting down when invalid data types (like numbers in string fields) are encountered in `config.yml`.

- **Improved Discord Error Handling**:
  - Added simplified, readable error messages for Discord bot initialization failures.
  - Added explicit database availability checks to prevent crashes if the database is disconnected.
  - Stack traces are now hidden by default and can be enabled via `debug.enabled` in `config.yml`.

### Security & Permissions

- **New Bypass Permissions**:
  - `aevorinreports.bypass.cooldown`: Allows specified players/ranks to bypass the reporting cooldown.
  - `aevorinreports.bypass.limit`: Allows specified players/ranks to bypass the active report limit.

## [1.0.4.3] - 2026-01-05

### Discord Network Mode

- **Network Mode for Multi-Server Setups**: Added a new `network-mode` configuration option for Discord integration.
  - Only ONE server in your network should enable `discord.network-mode.enabled: true`
  - This designated server will poll the database for new reports from ALL servers in the network via a reliable ID-based system.
  - Configurable poll interval (default: 10 seconds).
  - Perfect for networks where you want centralized Discord notifications without running the bot on every server.
- **Improved Reliability**: Switched to ID-based tracking to ensure no reports are duplicated or missed, even across server restarts.
