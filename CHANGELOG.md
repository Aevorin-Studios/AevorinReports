# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.8] - Hasn't been Released yet

### New Features

- **Standardized Messaging System**:
  - Replaced hardcoded messages with localized strings via `LanguageManager`.
  - Fully localized command usage strings (`/report`, `/viewreport`, `/setreportstatus`) for all supported languages.
  - Added localized feedback for the `/ar reload` command.
- **Custom Reason Support in GUIs**:
  - Added "Custom Reason" option to the **Book GUI**.
  - Added "Custom Reason" (Writable Book) icon to the **Container GUI** for players to submit their own reasons in chat.
- **Enhanced Visual Aesthetics**:
  - Implemented high-fidelity **MiniMessage gradients** for report titles, details, and notifications.
  - Simplified GUI design by removing bold text for a cleaner, modern look.
  - Redesigned the container separator for better visual structure.
- **Improved Global Prefix**: The plugin prefix now supports MiniMessage gradients and is consistently applied across all messages using the `{prefix}` placeholder.

### Improvements & Bug Fixes

- **Hybrid Message Parsing**: Implemented a robust "Hybrid Parser" for messages that contain both MiniMessage tags and legacy color codes (e.g., gradients combined with `&f`). This resolves a critical `ParsingException` where MiniMessage would crash when encountering legacy formatting symbols like `§`.
- **FastStats Reliability**: Fixed a `NullPointerException` (NPE) that occurred during FastStats initialization if the database connection failed or was slow to respond.
- **Streamlined Initialization**: Simplified console output during startup by removing verbose database connection logs and retry spam. Initialization failures are now reported as a single, clear sentence before the plugin disables itself.
- **GUI Pagination Fix**: Resolved a critical indexing error in the `Reason Selector` GUI that prevented "Next Page" from working when reasons spanned multiple pages.
- **Robust Reason Selection**: Implemented `PersistentDataContainer` (PDC) to identify report reasons in the GUI. This makes reason selection immune to translation changes and fixes a bug where non-English reasons would fail to submit.
- **Smart Message Parsing**: Enhanced `MessageUtils` with a heuristic to detect legacy color codes versus MiniMessage tags. This fixes a rendering bug where command usage strings like `<player>` were being incorrectly parsed as broken MiniMessage.
- **Dynamic Prefix Replacement**: Re-engineered the `LanguageManager` to replace `{prefix}` _before_ MiniMessage parsing, preventing crashes when the prefix contains non-legacy characters.
- **Robust Category Handling**: Switched to `PersistentDataContainer` for identifying report categories in GUIs, ensuring stability across all localized versions.
- **Unified Feedback**: Standardized status update notifications so that using the `/setreportstatus` command and the GUI management buttons provide the same detailed feedback.
- **Improved Input Validation**:
  - Validated report categories and custom reasons directly in the `/report` command.
  - Fixed length validation for custom reasons to correctly use localized error messages.
- **Language Cleanup**: Removed redundant and unused keys from language files (`status-update-success`, `description-too-short`, etc.) to reduce clutter and improve maintainability.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-03-11

### New Features

- **Full Localization Support**: Implemented a comprehensive language system.
  - New `lang/` folder for storing language packs (e.g., `en_US.yml`).
  - Active language selection via `language` setting in `config.yml`.
  - Added default `en_US.yml` with all GUI and message strings.
- **Localized GUIs**: Refactored all user interfaces to be fully translatable.
  - `ReportManageGUI`: Localized all labels and status buttons.
  - `CategoryContainerGUI`: Localized navigation and indicators.
  - `ReportReasonContainerGUI`: Localized the entire reason selection flow.
  - `BookGUI`: Localized the classic book-based reporting and management views.
- **Localized Commands**: All command feedback and staff notifications are now localized via the language pack.
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Added "Back" buttons to all container-based GUIs.
  - New "Back to Categories" button in the category view for easier navigation between report groups.
  - New "Back to Category" button in the individual report management view, allowing staff to return quickly to the filtered list.
  - Back buttons use localized display names and lore, including dynamic status placeholders.
- **Official Language Support**: Expanded the built-in language library.
  - Added official support for **Italian (it_IT)** and **Slovak (sk_SK)**.
- **Integrated FastStats Telemetry**: Added advanced server metrics and automated error tracking via FastStats.
  - **Live Metrics**: We now track pending reports, preferred GUI types, and database backends to help improve future updates.
  - **Automated Error Tracking**: Plugin exceptions are now automatically transmitted with context to our developers, allowing us to fix bugs before you even report them.
- **Improved Telemetry Coexistence**: FastStats now runs alongside bStats, providing a more comprehensive overview of plugin usage and health.

### Improvements & Bug Fixes

- **Book GUI Smart Pagination**: Fixed a bug where the text in the Book GUI would overflow and get cut off at the bottom of the page. The plugin now intelligently flows content onto a new page only when necessary.
- **Language Extraction Fix**: Fixed an issue where bundled language files (`it_IT.yml`, `sk_SK.yml`) would not extract to the `lang/` folder unless explicitly set as the active language. Now all supported languages extract automatically on startup.
- **Improved Language Management**:
  - **Custom Language Support**: Custom language files will never be overwritten during plugin updates.
  - **Smart Fallback System**: Missing keys in custom language files automatically fall back to `en_US` defaults.
  - **Missing Key Warnings**: Console warnings are displayed when custom language files have missing fields.
  - **Automatic Internal Updates**: Supported languages are auto-updated when the plugin jar is updated.
- **GUI Interaction Fix**: Fixed a bug where both admins and players could accidentally take items out of the container-based GUIs.
- **Security & Privacy**:
  - Fixed a missing permission check in the Book GUI that allowed non-admin players to see "Click to change status" options.
  - Management buttons are now context-aware and only shown to players with the correct permissions.
- **Build Process Optimization**: Fixed a critical issue where the Gradle build process was corrupting `\n` newline characters in language files.
- **Enhanced GUI Stability**: Re-engineered the internal GUI identification system using `InventoryHolder`.
- **Refined Config Logic**: Updated internal configuration handling to support advanced telemetry metrics.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved the `ExceptionHandler` to provide better context for remote debugging.
- **Code Refactoring**: Centralized GUI opening logic and standardized the use of `DARK_OAK_DOOR` as the universal "Back" icon.

- **Improved Discord Error Handling**:
  - Added simplified, readable error messages for Discord bot initialization failures.
  - Added explicit database availability checks to prevent crashes if the database is disconnected.
  - Stack traces are now hidden by default and can be enabled via `debug.enabled` in `config.yml`.

### Security & Permissions

- **New Bypass Permissions**:
  - `aevorinreports.bypass.cooldown`: Allows specified players/ranks to bypass the reporting cooldown.
  - `aevorinreports.bypass.limit`: Allows specified players/ranks to bypass the active report limit.

## [1.0.4.3] - 2026-01-05

### Discord Network Mode

- **Network Mode for Multi-Server Setups**: Added a new `network-mode` configuration option for Discord integration.
  - Only ONE server in your network should enable `discord.network-mode.enabled: true`
  - This designated server will poll the database for new reports from ALL servers in the network via a reliable ID-based system.
  - Configurable poll interval (default: 10 seconds).
  - Perfect for networks where you want centralized Discord notifications without running the bot on every server.
- **Improved Reliability**: Switched to ID-based tracking to ensure no reports are duplicated or missed, even across server restarts.
- **Duplication Fix**: Resolved issues where reports on the bot-server could be sent twice.

- **Discord Integration**: Added a robust Discord integration with a dedicated bot.
- **Improved Database Logs**: Simplified database connection error messages to be cleaner and more readable (no more giant stack traces).
- **Configuration Cleanup**: Removed the unused "Security" section and encryption key logic for a leaner `config.yml`.
- **Folia Compatibility**: Ensured all new features, including the Discord bot's background tasks, are fully compatible with Folia servers.

### Discord Integration Features

- **Dynamic Bot Presence**: Configure the bot's status (Online, Idle, etc.) and activity (Watching, Playing, etc.) with support for the `%online_players%` placeholder.
- **Real-time Notifications**: Receive beautifully formatted embeds for new reports in your Discord channel.
- **Slash Commands**:
  - `/reports`: List all active pending reports.
  - `/lookup <id>`: View detailed information about a specific report.
  - `/resolve <id>`, `/reject <id>`, `/pending <id>`: Manage report statuses directly from Discord.
  - `/help`: Detailed help menu for the bot.
- **Smart Formatting**: The "Server" field in Discord embeds automatically hides itself if you are only running a single server, matching the in-game behavior.
- **Customizable Aesthetics**: Independent color settings for report alerts and lookup results in `config.yml`.

## [1.0.4.1] - 2025-12-20

- **Changed the Book Gui's Reason to be like this: "Reason: Hover to See"**
