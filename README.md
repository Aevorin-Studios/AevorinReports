## Region Restriction

**AevorinReports** is designed to be used globally; however, please note that the plugin is **restricted and will not function** on servers located within **Israel**. This is enforced via automated IP/timezone verification.

## 4. Report Workflow

1. A player submits a report using `/report`
2. Staff members receive instant notifications
3. Report is marked as **Pending**
4. Staff review the report via the Admin GUI
5. Report is marked as **Resolved** or **Rejected**

All actions are logged and synchronized across servers when using MySQL.

---

## 5. Configuration (`config.yml`)

This section documents every available option in `config.yml`, explaining its purpose and recommended usage.

---

### Config Version System

```yaml
# Please Do not change the config version
config-version: 5
```

The `config-version` field is used by AevorinReports to **automatically manage and migrate your configuration** when the plugin is updated to a newer version that requires changes to `config.yml`.

#### How It Works

1. When the plugin loads, it reads the `config-version` value from your existing `config.yml`.
2. It compares that value against the version bundled inside the current plugin `.jar`.
3. **If they match**: No migration is needed. The plugin proceeds normally.
4. **If the bundled version is higher**: The plugin automatically:
   - Creates a backup of your existing file as `config.yml.old`.
   - Migrates all your existing settings (server name, database credentials, Discord token, etc.) into the new structure.
   - Writes a fresh `config.yml` with all new required fields, preserving your data.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Never manually edit the `config-version` field.** Changing it will cause the plugin to skip or repeat migrations, which can corrupt your configuration. If you need to reset the config, simply delete `config.yml` and restart the server.

> [!TIP]
> Your old config is always safely backed up as `config.yml.old` before any migration runs. If something goes wrong, you can restore your settings from that file.

---

### 5.0 Language Settings

```yaml
language: "en_US"
```

- Sets the active language file loaded from the `plugins/AevorinReports/lang/` folder.
- The value must match a `.yml` filename inside that folder (without the extension).
- **Built-in languages** (automatically extracted on first startup):
  - `en_US` – English (default)
  - `it_IT` – Italian
  - `sk_SK` – Slovak
- **Custom language files**: You can create your own `.yml` file inside the `lang/` folder.
  - Custom files are **never overwritten** by plugin updates.
  - Any keys missing in a custom file will automatically fall back to `en_US` values, so the plugin will never break due to untranslated strings.
  - A console warning will list any missing keys to help you keep translations up to date.

---

### 5.1 Server Configuration

```yaml
server-name: "survival"
```

- **server-name**: Identifies the server in multi-server setups.
  - Must be unique when multiple servers share the same database.
  - Displayed in Discord embeds and network-wide logs.

---

### 5.2 Database Configuration

```yaml
database:
  type: "file" # mysql or file
```

#### Database Types

- **file**: Uses local SQLite storage (recommended for single servers).
- **mysql**: Enables cross-server synchronization for networks.

#### MySQL Settings

```yaml
mysql:
  host: "localhost"
  port: 3306
  database: "aevorin_reports"
  username: "root"
  password: "password"
```

- Used only when `type` is set to `mysql`.
- All servers must share the same credentials for synchronization.

#### File Storage

```yaml
file:
  path: "database/reports.db"
```

- Location of the SQLite database file.

#### Connection Pool (Advanced)

```yaml
pool:
  minimum-idle: 5
  maximum-pool-size: 10
  connection-timeout: 30000
```

- Optimizes database performance.
- Recommended to leave defaults unless tuning is required.

---

### 5.3 Report Settings

```yaml
reports:
  allow-self-reporting: false
```

- Prevents players from reporting themselves when disabled.

#### GUI Configuration

```yaml
gui:
  type: "book" # book or container
```

- **book**: Classic book-style interface.
- **container**: Modern chest-style GUI.

#### Limits & Cooldowns

```yaml
cooldown: 300
max-active-reports: 3
```

- **cooldown**: Time (seconds) between report submissions.
- **max-active-reports**: Maximum unresolved reports per player.

#### Custom Reasons

```yaml
allow-custom-reasons: true
custom-reason-min-length: 10
custom-reason-max-length: 100
```

- Allows players to submit custom reasons via chat.
- Length limits prevent spam and abuse.

#### Report Categories

```yaml
categories:
  - "Hacking/Cheating"
  - "Harassment/Bullying"
  - "Spam/Advertisement"
```

- Displayed in the report GUI.
- Categories are fully customizable.

---

### 5.4 Notification Settings

```yaml
notifications:
  new-report: true
  status-change: true
  sound: "BLOCK_NOTE_BLOCK_PLING"
```

- **new-report**: Notify staff when a report is created.
- **status-change**: Notify staff when report status changes.
- **sound**: Sound played for staff alerts (empty string disables).

#### Chat Prefix

The chat prefix, which appears before most plugin messages, is configured within the **language files** to allow for localized branding.

```yaml
# Found in lang/en_US.yml
messages:
  prefix: "&8[&bAevorinReports&8]&r "
```

---

### 5.5 Update Checker

```yaml
update-checker:
  check-interval: 60
  notify-on-join: true
```

- Automatically checks for new plugin versions.
- Notifies authorized players on join.

---

### 5.6 Debug Settings

```yaml
debug:
  enabled: false
  log-queries: false
```

- **enabled**: Enables detailed debug logging.

---

### 5.7 Message Customization

```yaml
messages:
  report-created: "&aYour report has been submitted successfully!"
```

- Fully customizable messages.
- Supports color codes (`&`) and placeholders.
- MiniMessage is supported where applicable.

---

### 5.8 Discord Integration

```yaml
discord:
  enabled: false
```

#### Network Mode (Multi-Server)

```yaml
network-mode:
  enabled: false # set to true on ONE server only in a network
  poll-interval: 10 # how often to sync reports from the database (seconds)
```

- **enabled**: If `true`, this server will poll the database for reports from all servers.
- **poll-interval**: The frequency of database checks. Recommended: 5-10.

#### Core Settings

```yaml
bot-token: "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
channel-id: "YOUR_CHANNEL_ID_HERE"
log-channel-id: "YOUR_LOG_CHANNEL_ID_HERE"
```

### FastStats

AevorinReports also uses **FastStats** for advanced, real-time plugin analytics. The following custom metrics are tracked to help guide future development:

| Metric                  | Description                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pending_reports`       | Number of currently pending reports on the server      |
| `total_reports`         | Total reports ever created on the server               |
| `gui_provider`          | Which GUI type the server uses (`book` or `container`) |
| `db_backend`            | Which database backend is in use (`file` or `mysql`)   |
| `configured_categories` | How many report categories the server has set up       |
| `discord_integration`   | Whether the Discord bot is enabled (`true`/`false`)    |

All telemetry is anonymous — no player data, usernames, IPs, or personally identifiable information is ever collected.
